=head2 DEPENDENCIES

The AII was tested with OpenNebula version 4.8 and 4.1x

Following package dependencies should be installed to run the AII:

=over

=item * perl-Config-Tiny

=item * perl-CAF

=item * perl-Set-Scalar

=item * perl-Net-OpenNebula >= 0.2.2 !

=back

Set OpenNebula endpoints RPC connector /etc/aii/opennebula.conf

It must include at least one RPC endpoint and password.

By default ONE AII uses oneadmin user and port 2633.

It is also possible to set a different endpoint for each VM domain or use a fqdn pattern
as example:

    [rpc]
    password=
    host=

    [example.com]
    password=
    user=
    host=
    port=

    [myhosts]
